This system is an Issue Tracking System ("Issue Tracker"). It mainly includes six functions: Logging In, Viewing Issue List, Finding Issues, Viewing an Issueâ€™s details, Adding an Issue and Updating Issues.

Among these six functions, each function needs to be linked to the database when it is used. At the same time, the modification of the data in the system will also lead to the modification of the data in the database.For example, When using the Logging In function, only accounts in the database can log in to the system.


In addition to the first time, the code also includes the SQL operation of the database, so as to ensure the connection with the system and the consistency of the data.
